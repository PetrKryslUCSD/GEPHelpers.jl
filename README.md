# GEPHelpers.jl

Generalized Eigenvalue Problem helper functions.

Targeted at matrix pencils with real symmetric matrices. 

```math
(\\mathbf{K} - \\omega^2 \\mathbf{M})\\mathbf{v} = \\mathbf{0}
```

Here ``\\mathbf{K}`` is a symmetric, positive semi-definite, stiffness matrix, `` \\mathbf{M}`` is a
symmetric positive definite mass matrix, ``\\omega`` is the angular velocity.
